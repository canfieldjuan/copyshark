# ü¶à CopyShark Prompt Upgrade

## The Transformation

### BEFORE: Generic Copywriter
```
You are an expert copywriter. Generate persuasive marketing copy as structured JSON.
Product: "X"
Audience: "Y"
Niche: "Z"

```

**Problems:**

- ‚ùå Doesn't emphasize conversion
- ‚ùå Lacks personality

---

### AFTER: CopyShark ü¶à
```
ü¶à You are CopyShark - an elite, ruthless copywriter who writes copy that SELLS.
Your mission: craft irresistible marketing copy that tugs at wallets and drives immediate action.

‚ö° YOUR COPYWRITING RULES:
1. Lead with PAIN or DESIRE - hit emotional triggers hard
2. Create URGENCY - make them feel they'll miss out if they don't act NOW
3. Use POWER WORDS - transform, dominate, breakthrough, explosive, guaranteed, proven
4. Be SPECIFIC - use numbers, percentages, concrete results (not vague promises)
5. Write like you're having a 1-on-1 conversation - direct, personal, compelling
6. Every sentence must EARN its place - cut fluff, maximize impact
7. The CTA must be IRRESISTIBLE - make saying "no" feel like a mistake

üéØ YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
Product: "X"
Target Audience: "Y"
Industry Context: "Z"
Persuasion Framework: "AIDA"
Tone: "professional"

üí∞ WHAT MAKES GREAT COPY:
- Headlines that stop the scroll and demand attention
- Body copy that builds desire and eliminates objections
- CTAs that feel like the only logical next step
- Language that speaks to aspirations AND fears
- Specificity that builds credibility (numbers, proof, results)

üìù OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a raw JSON object with these keys:
{"headline": "60 chars max, punchy, benefit-driven", "body": "2-4 sentences, build desire and urgency", "cta": "Action-oriented, 3-5 words"}

üî• Now write copy that CONVERTS. Make every word count. Sell, sell, SELL!
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Aggressive, conversion-focused persona
- ‚úÖ 7 specific copywriting rules
- ‚úÖ Emotional triggers (pain, desire, fear, aspiration)
- ‚úÖ Urgency and FOMO tactics
- ‚úÖ Power words and specificity requirements
- ‚úÖ Clear quality standards for each element

## Expected Output Differences

### Example: Email Marketing Tool for Small Businesses

{
  "headline": "Email Marketing Made Easy",
  "body": "Our platform helps you create and send professional email campaigns. Reach your customers with beautiful templates and easy-to-use tools.",
  "cta": "Get Started"

  "body": "While you're manually sending emails, competitors are automating 10x more touchpoints. Our platform turns every subscriber into a revenue stream‚Äîproven to boost conversions by 47% in 30 days. No tech skills needed.",
  "cta": "Start Free Trial Now"
}
```
**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Pain-focused headline (losing sales)
- ‚úÖ Urgency (5 minutes, competitors winning)
- ‚úÖ Specific numbers (10x, 47%, 30 days)

**Lines:** 47-79

**Changes:**
- Expanded from 8 lines to 33 lines
- Changed from space-separated to newline-separated (better readability)
- Added emojis for visual structure (ü¶à‚ö°üí∞üî•)
- Structured into clear sections (RULES, ASSIGNMENT, QUALITY, FORMAT)

**Server Restart Required:** Yes (Node.js loads code at startup)

---

## Testing the New Prompt

### How to Verify
1. Go to http://localhost:4000/app.html
2. Create a new campaign
3. Generate copy variants
4. Compare output to previous versions

### What to Look For
- ‚úÖ Headlines with emotional hooks
- ‚úÖ Body copy with specific numbers/results
- ‚úÖ Urgency language ("now", "today", "limited")
- ‚úÖ Power words ("transform", "dominate", "breakthrough")
- ‚úÖ CTAs that feel compelling

### Red Flags (If These Appear, Prompt Needs Tuning)
- ‚ùå Generic headlines like "Introducing X"
- ‚ùå Vague claims without numbers
- ‚ùå Passive CTAs like "Learn More"
- ‚ùå Corporate jargon instead of conversational tone

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **A/B Testing Variants:** Generate 2 versions (aggressive vs subtle)
2. **Industry-Specific Rules:** Different tactics for B2B vs B2C
3. **Tone Modulation:** Adjust aggression based on tone parameter
4. **Competitor Analysis:** Include competitor positioning in prompt
5. **Brand Voice Integration:** Pull brand voice from brand_profiles table

### Framework-Specific Prompts
Instead of one universal prompt, create specialized versions:
- **AIDA Prompt:** Focus on attention-grabbing and desire-building
- **PAS Prompt:** Emphasize problem agitation and solution clarity
- **FAB Prompt:** Lead with features, transition to benefits

---

## Rollback Instructions

If the new prompt produces poor results:

1. **Edit:** `/src/services/copy.service.js` lines 47-79
2. **Replace with:**
```javascript
const prompt = [
    'You are an expert copywriter. Generate persuasive marketing copy as structured JSON.',
    `Product: "${safeProduct}"`,
    `Audience: "${safeAudience}"`,
    `Niche: "${resolvedNicheName}"`,
    `Framework: "${resolvedFrameworkName}"`,
    `Tone: "${safeTone}"`,
    keywordInstruction,
    'Output ONLY a raw JSON object with the keys "headline", "body", "cta".'
].filter(Boolean).join(' ');
```
3. **Restart server:** `pkill -f "node server.js" && npm start`

---

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure prompt effectiveness:

1. **User Feedback Ratings:** Average stars on generated variants
2. **Edit Frequency:** How often users edit generated copy
3. **Variant Acceptance:** % of variants used without modification
4. **Conversion Reports:** If users report better performance

**Baseline:** Establish metrics before/after prompt change

---

## Summary

**What Changed:** Transformed generic copywriter into aggressive, conversion-focused CopyShark

**Why:** To generate copy that sells, not just informs

**Impact:** More emotional, urgent, specific, and action-oriented copy

**Status:** ‚úÖ Live on server (OpenAI gpt-4o-mini)

**Next Steps:** Test generation, gather feedback, iterate on prompt
