# CopyShark Project Log & Implementation Plan

This document outlines the development plan for enhancing the CopyShark application. All steps will be executed following strict verification and validation protocols.

## Guiding Principles

- **Never Assume, Always Verify:** All assumptions about the codebase will be validated by reading the relevant files before any changes are made.
- **Validate Changes:** Changes will be tested in isolation where possible to ensure they work as intended before being integrated.
- **Incremental Updates:** Progress will be logged here to ensure session continuity.
- **Verify Code:** Existing code will be reviewed before modification.
- **Precise Insertion:** Exact file paths and code insertion points will be identified before writing any code.
- **Confirm Functionality:** All changes will be tested to confirm they work and have not introduced regressions.

## Phase 1: Foundational Improvements (Stability & Maintainability)

- **Status:** Completed

### 1.1. Implement Structured Logging

- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Installed `pino` and `pino-http`. Replaced all `console.log` and `console.error` calls in `server.js` and `database.js` with a structured logger. Corrected middleware order to ensure API routes are reachable.

### 1.2. Add Hot Reloading for Development

- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Installed `nodemon` as a dev dependency and added a `dev` script to `package.json`.

### 1.3. Enhance Error Handling

- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Created custom error classes (`ApiError`, `BadRequestError`, `UnauthorizedError`) in `utils/errors.js`. Refactored the main error handler and authentication routes in `server.js` to use these classes, providing clearer error responses.

### 1.4. Add a Testing Framework

- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Installed `jest` and `supertest`. Created a `jest.config.js` file and a `test` script. Added an initial test for the `/api/health` endpoint and configured the server to run without port conflicts during tests.

---

## Phase 2: Feature Extension & Niche Specialization

- **Status:** In Progress

### 2.1. Decouple Niches & Frameworks from Code

- **Status:** Completed
- **Goal:** Move hardcoded data into the database.
- **Summary:** Added `niches` and `frameworks` tables to the database schema. Created a standalone seed script to populate the tables. Updated the API endpoints to serve data from the database and removed the old hardcoded files.

### 2.2. Implement Niche-Specific Knowledge Priming

- **Status:** Completed
- **Goal:** Improve copy quality by providing the AI with niche-specific keywords.
- **Summary:** Added `niche_keywords` support to both SQLite and PostgreSQL schemas, refreshed taxonomy caching in `server.js`, and inject niche keywords into prompts via a shared builder used by the HTTP route and AI Portal function. Seed script now loads the `llm-tuning` keywords and a default set of niches/frameworks for continuity.
- **Key File Updates:**
    - `database.js`: Created logging-aware schema bootstrap, added taxonomy lookup helpers, and ensured keyword table creation for both drivers.
    - `scripts/seed_db.js`: Rebuilt seeding workflow with shared datasets and duplicate-safe inserts for niches, frameworks, and keywords.
    - `server.js`: Centralized prompt creation, added taxonomy caches/keywords, enhanced logging, and wired graceful hot reload handling.
- **Verification Steps:**
    1. Analyze the prompt construction logic in `server.js` inside the `/api/generate-copy` endpoint.
    2. Ensure `database.js` exports the new taxonomy accessors and `getKeywordsForNiche` helper.
    3. Confirm the seeding script populates keywords for "LLM Fine-tuning and Training".
- **Validation Steps:**
    1. Ran `npm test` to exercise the health endpoint (passes under Jest).
    2. Executed `node scripts/seed_db.js`; verified `niche_keywords` table contains seeded rows via `sqlite3` inspection.

## Phase 3: UI/UX and Final Integration

- **Status:** Completed

### 3.1. Implement Usage Tracking and Enforcement

- **Status:** Completed
- **Goal:** Wire usage tracking into the copy generation flow and enforce plan limits.
- **Summary:** Enhanced `/api/generate-copy` endpoint to support both authenticated and anonymous requests. For authenticated users, the system now checks usage limits based on their plan (free: 10, pro: unlimited) and increments usage count after successful generation. Added comprehensive logging for usage events and limit enforcement.
- **Key Changes:**
    - `server.js`: Modified `/api/generate-copy` to extract JWT token, verify user, check limits, and increment usage count.
    - Graceful handling of anonymous requests (no token) and AI Portal requests (API key).
    - Returns 429 error when free plan users exceed their 10 request limit.

### 3.2. Create Authentication-Aware Frontend

- **Status:** Completed
- **Goal:** Build a modern frontend that surfaces login state, plan info, and usage data.
- **Summary:** Created `frontend/app.html` with complete auth flow including login/register forms, JWT token management, and real-time usage display. The UI shows current plan, usage count with visual progress bar, and enforces authentication for full access.
- **Key Features:**
    - Login and registration forms with error handling
    - JWT token storage in localStorage
    - User info panel showing email, plan badge, and usage statistics
    - Visual usage bar with color-coded warnings (green -> yellow -> red)
    - Automatic token validation on page load
    - All taxonomy and model endpoints integrated
    - Graceful error messages tied to backend limits

### 3.3. Expand Test Coverage

- **Status:** Completed
- **Goal:** Add comprehensive tests for auth flows and copy generation endpoints.
- **Summary:** Expanded Jest test suite from 2 to 18 tests covering health, taxonomy, authentication, copy generation, and AI Portal integration endpoints.
- **Test Coverage Added:**
    - Health and info endpoints (3 tests)
    - Taxonomy endpoints (2 tests)
    - Authentication flow (6 tests): registration, login, duplicate email handling, invalid credentials, user info retrieval
    - Copy generation (2 tests): validation and successful generation
    - AI Portal integration (5 tests): function calling, authentication, error handling
- **Verification:** All 18 tests passing with comprehensive logging output.

### Session Log 2025-10-14 (Updated)
- Reviewed existing project log and backend sources to verify Phase 2 progress and identify gaps around niche keyword priming.
- Refactored database schema/bootstrap, seeding pipeline, and server prompt builder to incorporate `niche_keywords` with caching and robust logging.
- Added graceful hot-reload handling for nodemon-driven development and strengthened API fallback behaviours when the database is unavailable.
- Validation: `npm test`, `node scripts/seed_db.js`, and manual `sqlite3` queries confirmed table creation and keyword seeding.
- Wired the frontend dropdowns to `/api/niches` and `/api/frameworks`, keeping fallback options and visible status messaging when data loads from cache.
- Surfaced niche and framework descriptions inline in the UI so selections now show contextual helper text while preserving the same fallback behaviour.
- Replaced the Gemini-only LLM client with a provider-agnostic orchestrator that selects OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google based on `.env` configuration, exposes `/api/models`, and wires the frontend to choose models dynamically.
- Tests: `npm test` now covers `/api/models` to ensure the configured catalog remains accessible without live credentials.

**Phase 3 Completion (Current Session):**
- Implemented usage tracking and limit enforcement in `/api/generate-copy` endpoint with JWT authentication support.
- Created comprehensive authentication-aware frontend (`frontend/app.html`) with login/register flows, plan badges, and visual usage tracking.
- Expanded Jest test suite from 2 to 18 tests covering all major endpoints including auth, copy generation, and AI Portal integration.
- All tests passing successfully (18/18).
- Updated server.js to serve new authenticated frontend by default.
- Added robust logging throughout the copy generation flow for tracking usage events and limit enforcement.

**Next Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Plan upgrade workflow (free to pro conversion)
- Admin dashboard for user/usage management
- Batch copy generation for multiple products
- Copy history and favorites feature
- Export functionality (PDF, CSV)
- Advanced analytics and A/B testing support

## Phase 4: Modularization & Architecture Refactor

- **Status:** Planning Complete
- **Start Date:** 2025-10-15

### 4.1. Modular Architecture Implementation Plan

- **Status:** Planning Complete
- **Goal:** Transform CopyShark from monolithic (670-line server.js) to modular architecture
- **Document:** `MODULAR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- **Timeline:** 7-8 weeks

**Current Architecture Issues Identified:**
- Single Responsibility Violation: server.js handles routing, business logic, and request handling
- Difficult Testing: Routes and business logic tightly coupled
- Poor Scalability: Adding features requires modifying massive file
- Code Duplication: Auth logic repeated in multiple route handlers
- Limited Reusability: Business logic embedded in routes

**Planned Target Architecture:**
```
src/
├── config/          # Centralized configuration
├── middleware/      # Reusable middleware (auth, validation, error handling)
├── routes/          # Route definitions (thin layer)
├── controllers/     # HTTP request/response handling
├── services/        # Business logic layer
├── models/          # Data models and validation
├── database/        # Database adapters (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
└── utils/           # Shared utilities
```

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Week 1:** Foundation Setup & Config Extraction
2. **Week 2-3:** Extract Services (Auth, Copy, Taxonomy, User)
3. **Week 3-4:** Extract Controllers (HTTP layer)
4. **Week 4:** Extract Routes (Endpoint definitions)
5. **Week 5:** Refactor server.js (50-100 lines only)
6. **Week 5-6:** Database Abstraction Layer
7. **Week 6-7:** Testing Enhancement (50+ unit, 30+ integration, 10+ e2e tests)
8. **Week 7:** Documentation & Cleanup
9. **Week 8+:** Optional Enhancements (TypeScript, GraphQL, etc.)

**Success Metrics:**
- Lines per file: <200 (server.js currently 670)
- Test coverage: >80% (currently ~40%)
- Functions per file: <20
- Total tests: 100+ (currently 18)

**Key Principles:**
- Never assume, always verify
- Validate each change works before proceeding
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility
- Incremental implementation with testing at each step
- No placeholders, stubs, or TODOs in production code

### Session Log 2025-10-15

- **Analyzed Current Architecture:**
  - Reviewed project_log.md, STATUS.md, PHASE3_SUMMARY.md, CHECKLIST.md
  - Examined server.js (670 lines - monolithic)

    - 72% increase in test coverage
    - No breaking changes
    - Server configuration working correctly

- **Next Steps:**
  - Extract middleware modules (auth, validation, error handling)
  - Create middleware tests
  - Continue Phase 1 implementation
  - Target: Complete Phase 1 by end of week

- **Phase 1 Implementation Continued:**
  - Extracted middleware layer (`src/middleware/auth.js`, `apiKey.js`, `validation.js`, `errorHandler.js`, `index.js`) and recalibrated `server.js` to consume modular middleware plus shared validation flow.
  - Added dedicated middleware unit suites (`tests/unit/middleware/auth.test.js`, `validation.test.js`, `apiKey.test.js`).
  - Updated copy generation route to leverage optional auth + API key context and centralized error handling exports.
  - Attempted full Jest run (`npm test -- --runInBand`); blocked in sandbox with `listen EPERM 0.0.0.0`. Executed unit suites via `npx jest tests/unit --runInBand` pending integration rerun outside sandbox.

- **Phase 2 Implementation Initiated:**
  - Standardized runtime port to 4000 via `src/config/index.js` and corresponding `server.js` bootstrap logging.
  - Created service layer modules (`src/services/auth.service.js`, `copy.service.js`, `taxonomy.service.js`) with graceful fallbacks when the database or LLM client is unavailable.
  - Refactored authentication, copy generation, taxonomy endpoints, and AI Portal integrations in `server.js` to rely on the new services, reducing monolithic responsibilities.
  - Added comprehensive service unit suites (`tests/unit/services/auth.service.test.js`, `copy.service.test.js`, `taxonomy.service.test.js`) covering success paths, error handling, caching, and usage enforcement.
  - Re-ran unit suite via `npx jest tests/unit --runInBand` (40 tests); full Jest run remains blocked by sandbox port restrictions.

- **Phase 2 Implementation Continued:**
  - Implemented controller layer (`src/controllers/*.js`) to handle HTTP orchestration for auth, copy, taxonomy, user, AI portal, and meta endpoints.
  - Added modular routers (`src/routes/*.routes.js`) with centralized registration in `src/routes/index.js`, keeping endpoint paths unchanged while simplifying `server.js`.
  - Updated `server.js` to inject model catalog providers into controllers, register routers, and delegate error handling to shared middleware.
  - Executed `npx jest tests/unit --runInBand` after refactor (40 tests passing); integration suite still pending due to sandbox port restriction.

- **Phase 3 Feature Expansion Plan Logged:**
  - Captured new roadmap centered on brand profiles, campaign workspaces, variant management, copy history, and export/share flows to elevate conversion-readiness.
  - Defined six-phase implementation timeline (Phase 0 discovery through Phase 5 hardening) with explicit validation checkpoints (dual-database schema verification, unit+integration coverage, frontend QA scripts).
  - Established success metrics (campaign reuse, variant quality, export readiness) for post-release evaluation.

- **Phase 3 Implementation (Data Model & Backend APIs):**
  - Authored `docs/schema/phase3-data-model.md` covering brand profiles, campaign projects, variants, and feedback; extended `database.js` to provision new tables/indexes for SQLite & PostgreSQL alongside CRUD helpers.
  - Added `src/services/brand.service.js` and `src/services/project.service.js` with comprehensive Jest unit tests to manage profiles, projects, variants, favorites, and feedback flows.
  - Introduced controllers/routes for brands, projects, and variants; updated `server.js`/router registry so authenticated users can manage profiles, campaigns, and stored copy variants.
  - Enhanced copy generation controller to optionally persist generated variants against authorized projects (with context metadata) while preserving legacy anonymous behaviour.
  - Validation: `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./copyshark.db node -e "require('./database')"`, `sqlite3 copyshark.db ".tables"`, and `npx jest tests/unit --runInBand` (52/52 tests passing).

- **Phase 3 Implementation (Frontend Workspace & Graph Integration):**
  - Rebuilt `frontend/app.html` as a modular React workspace (brand board, campaign board, variant lab, knowledge graph panel) using a vendored lightweight React runtime (`frontend/vendor/react-lite.js`).
  - Added GraphITI proxy service/controller/routes plus config toggles (`GRAPHITI_BASE_URL`, `GRAPHITI_API_KEY`, `GRAPHITI_TIMEOUT_MS`) and wired variant feedback episodes into GraphITI when enabled.
  - Extended knowledge panel to fetch insights via `/api/graph/insights`, refresh on feedback/generation, and gracefully degrade when the graph stack is disabled.
  - Updated front-end export, favorites, and feedback flows; variant generation now refreshes graph insights when available.
  - Unit suites expanded (`npx jest tests/unit --runInBand`) to 56 passing tests covering new graph service fallbacks.
