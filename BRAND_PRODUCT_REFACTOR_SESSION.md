# Brand Profile & Product Catalog Refactor - Session Log

**Started:** October 16, 2025, 4:30 PM  
**Objective:** Implement brand profile + product catalog architecture

---

## Session 1: Planning & Discovery (4:30 PM - 5:00 PM)

### User Requirements Confirmed
✅ **ONE brand profile per user** (simpler, cleaner)  
✅ **Product fields:** Name, Description, Target Audience, USPs, Price Point, Category  
✅ **Migration strategy:** Auto-create brand + products from existing data  
✅ **UI Navigation:** TBD as we build

### Discovery Phase - Database Analysis

**Current Schema Verified:**
```sql
-- brand_profiles: Allows multiple brands per user
UNIQUE(user_id, name)  -- Can have multiple brands with different names

-- copy_projects: Links to brand_id (no product_id yet)
FOREIGN KEY (brand_id) REFERENCES brand_profiles (id)
```

**Current Data:**
- 1 brand exists: `name="Dev Ops"`, `brand_voice=NULL`
- 1 project exists
- User ID: `18bd96a6-8038-4e1f-8a09-3eee9910a49b`

**Backend Files Verified:**
- ✅ `/src/controllers/brand.controller.js` - 82 lines, CRUD operations
- ✅ `/src/services/brand.service.js` - 111 lines, business logic
- ✅ `/database.js` - Database operations
- ✅ Routes configured

**Frontend Structure Discovered:**
- ✅ `/frontend/app.html` - 2011 lines
- ✅ Brand card component: Lines 820-860
- ✅ `BrandBoard` component exists
- ✅ `handleCreateBrand` function: Line 1639
- ✅ Brand selection flow in place

### Key Findings

**Database:**
- Schema supports multiple brands per user (needs constraint change)
- No products table exists (needs creation)
- No product_id in copy_projects (needs migration)

**Backend:**
- Brand service has good validation
- Controllers have ownership checks
- No product service exists (needs creation)

**Frontend:**
- Brand cards displayed in list
- Brand selection works
- Edit button (⚙️) already exists
- No product catalog UI (needs creation)

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK:**
1. Changing UNIQUE constraint could break existing multi-brand users
   - **Action:** Check if any users have multiple brands
   
2. Frontend refactor could break existing campaign creation
   - **Action:** Test thoroughly before deploying

**MEDIUM RISK:**
1. Copy generation changes might affect quality
   - **Action:** Compare prompts before/after

**LOW RISK:**
1. Adding products table (new feature, doesn't affect existing)
2. Enhanced logging (only adds observability)

### Questions to Answer Before Starting

1. **Do any users have multiple brands?**
   - Need to query: `SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) FROM brand_profiles GROUP BY user_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`
   
2. **Should we migrate existing projects to default products?**
   - Recommendation: Yes, create "Default Product" for each brand
   
3. **Should products be required for campaigns?**
   - Recommendation: Optional at first, required later

4. **What's the rollback plan?**
   - Recommendation: Database backup + git branch

## Implementation Plan Created

**Document:** `BRAND_PRODUCT_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`

**8 Phases Defined:**
1. Database Migration (1h)
2. Product API Backend (2h)
3. Brand API Enhancement (1.5h)
4. Copy Generation Enhancement (1h)
5. Product Catalog UI (3h)
6. Brand Profile Setup UI (2h)
7. Testing & Validation (2h)
8. Migration & Deployment (1h)

**Total Estimated Time:** 13.5 hours (2-3 days realistic)

## Pre-Flight Checks

### Before Starting Phase 1

- [ ] **Check for multi-brand users**
  ```sql
  SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as brand_count 
  FROM brand_profiles 
  GROUP BY user_id 
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  ```

- [ ] **Backup database**
  ```bash
  cp copyshark.db copyshark.db.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
  ```

- [ ] **Create git branch**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/brand-product-refactor
  ```

- [ ] **Run existing tests**
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- [ ] **Verify server is running**
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:4000/api/meta
  ```

## Next Actions

**Immediate:**
1. Run pre-flight checks
2. Get approval to proceed
3. Start Phase 1: Database Migration

**Waiting On:**
- User approval to proceed
- Confirmation on multi-brand user strategy
- Decision on product requirement (optional vs required)

**Status:** 📋 PLANNING COMPLETE - READY TO START IMPLEMENTATION

**Files Created:**
- `BRAND_PRODUCT_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive implementation plan
- `BRAND_PRODUCT_REFACTOR_SESSION.md` - This session log
